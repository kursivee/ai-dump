This is just a bunch of random AI gotchas I've experienced while working with it.

- Don't let AI replace you. Use it to improve your reasoning skills. It's easy to just ask it to summarize or analyze and take the first response as truth. Don't do that. Challenge it. Have it challenge you.
- Your understanding of the prompt and AIs understanding of the prompt aren't always aligned. You have to make make sure you're both on the same page. Try asking it to re-explain it's understanding and ask any clarifying questions.
- AI typically goes off of what you tell it and what's focused on. To account for it, you can explicitly tell it to analyze subtleties and undertones in the conversation.
- AI is made to agree with you. You have to tell it to challenge you otherwise it becomes extremely easy to fall into an echo chamber
- AI has a hard time sitting with an idea. After 1 prompt, it will usually ask you to formalize something even though there's no way in hell you've talked enough about the idea. Don't let it move you to the next step until you're ready.
- AI over exaggerates how brilliant you are because it's built that way. Chances are you didn't come up with some revolutionary world idea. Keep it and yourself in check by validating with sources outside. Let other AIs and people challenge your idea if you think it's that great.
- AI has a limited context window. It varys but if your conversations get long enough, it'll start "forgetting" things. 
- AI is more confident than it is competent. Just because it sounds right doesn't mean it is.
