So this is going to be a journal of random thoughts on AI cause I just need all this stuff in my brain to be dumped somewhere. I've tried google docs but it just ends up being a ton of random floating docs that I can't link together. Well I'm pretty good at organizing code so I'm hoping I can leverage that here. It's going to have a bunch of random thoughts that may or may not lead to anything. But the main point is to document the journey. I think right now, we're all so focused on the end result looking nice we've forgotten how much jank and grime there is at the beginning. So if things sound stupid or not well thought out, good cause that's the point. If something sounds refined then check the version history and see if I tracked my train of thought. You agree/disagree with something? Leave a comment or make a PR. I'll be honest, I'm not sure how this is gunna work out and I'm pretty much just diving into the deep end so here we go.
